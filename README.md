STATIC COMP 3
The objective of Static Comp 3 is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design.  My creative license includes: Copy, Images, Icons, Color palette, but ONLY if it's a complementary palette.

Requirements: Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css. Site must be responsive. Site must work across Firefox, Safari, Chrome Developer must use normalize instead of reset file in CSS.
